#### TW : ED
When I tell someone that I take cold showers,


or paint my nails every time I get hungry, 


or starve myself for so long I faint when I stand up, 


I do not want them to push me towards recovery 


I have no desire to get better, 


Part of the reason I tell them 


is because I want that shocked expression ,


that worry,


but with no real consequences. 


The other part, 


secretly, deep down, 


and the one that makes me feel so fucked up and so guilty over,


is that I want a competitior. 


I want them to reply with even worse habits 


with ideas, 


with inspirations,


I want them to tell me how many days they fasted for 


so I can double it. 


I want them to tell me how much weight they have lost 


so I realize I have lost more. 


I want them to compete with me 


but lose. 


Eating disorders should not be competitive 


but god! I am yet to meet a rexie who doesn't burn with rage so hard


I feel the heat radiating off of them 


every time they realize they are not the skinniest person in the room.


I tell people sometimes, 


because I am so proud of the hurt I've caused my body 


Look, look how badly I can treat myself 


I bet you can't do that 


Can you? Have you? Do you?


Tell me 


Tell me everything 


I smell food instead of eating it 


I spit instaed of swallowing it 


I will do anything I can to stop those fucking calories from poisoning me. 


It is exhilarating 


So please stare at me again and tell me you think I have a problem 


Ugh! I am so addicted to your concern.
