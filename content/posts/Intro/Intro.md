Haha Hey! 


Why are you here? Oh let me guess, you are snooping around. Are you? No? 
Okay. Okay. Maybe you want to know me. Is that it? Oh come on at least tell me if I'm close. 

Wait wait, you fancy me? (I know you cant see this but I have a very cheeky smile right now). Oh I knew it. 
Is it just me or does fancy feel more romantic or like we are in a movie setting, the renditions are playinng and you, like the decent person you are is courting me? hahahhahaha 

What was I saying? Yeah I do a lot of that. I lose track of my trail of thought easily. So,,, welcome. 
Welcome home. I'd offer you pancakes but I've learnt a hard lessons of bystanders and visitors who come with no intention to stay and are not decent enough to clean up their mess. Ugh! I hate it so please dont overstay your welcome and be courteous enough to say goodbye.  
(I usually have a very heavy british accent when writing my rants so please do them justice. Did you emphasis the ts in hate it ?)

I do not consider myself a writer. I'm just a girl who writes about everything, every little thing in her life. It's a sickness at this point. All i'm saying, extend grace or not, i dont care. (I actually do and i hate that)
Some of these (rants) are true and some are not. I do not care enough to explain that. Are you still reading this nonsense? Aaaaaaw you must really like me. 


Anywayzz if you must know something about me 


    - I like reading. I like books in an unexplainable way. They almost define me.


    - I like baking. The process, the sugar and the smell in the kitchen afterwards. 


    - I am in love with pancakes. I love them the way Frank Sinatra sings; heartily. 


    - I love flowers. The fragility, the beauty and the softness. 


    - I love music. I think I can sing and I use my spotify to write my feelings as playlist titles 


    - I like design. The research, color psychology, the beauty of nothingness to something. 


    - I hate noise. It gives me terrible migraines 


    - Oh God, I have terrivle insomnia


    - I am sorta kinda too emotional  

    


Well... I hope you enjoy my ramblings.
