### Dear Little girl 
- You are not a second choice 
- They didnt choose you because you are not worthy 
- But because they weren't built to love you 
- I know their arms feel like they were
- supposed to carry you
- But the lack of their strength is not a testimony of the weight of your soul
- But rather the weakness of theirs.
- You are not too much.

### Sincerely, Your big sister.
