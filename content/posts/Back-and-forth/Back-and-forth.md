Two minutes


It's just two minutes of my day


I can sing the happy birthday song in my head


three times to distract myself.


back ... and forth


and it's so repetitive.


And I was always told


sometimes in life we have to do things we dont particularly like


back ... and forth


and i hate the taste of my mouth 


especially when i starts frothing up like ugh 


back ... and forth. 


am I done now?


I must be done now, it has to have been two minutes.


He -


He said it would only take two minutes 


back ... and forth 


he said it would be easy and quick and like brushing my teeth


This-


this is not like brushing my teeth 


I did not swallow my own tongue


He reached between my lips and took it from me.


I shut my mouth 


I did not want him to reach in again. 


I did not want him to take my teeth as well 


back ... and forth 


I thought, if i dont move and I just keep my mouth closed 


He''ll only invade one set of lips


back ... and forth 


Afterwards he gave me my tongue back


but it never really felt like it belonged to me again 


I did not use it 


I did not tell anyone 


I was too scared of losing another part of me 


as if mentioning what had happened meant it would happen again 


back ... and forth 


he made it sound so normal 


like everyone did it 


like it would be weird if I didn't 


back ... and forth 


if I mentioned it then I have to acknowledge it happened 


It was 


only two minutes 


it was just like brushing my teeth 


back ... and forth.
