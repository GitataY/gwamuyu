He made love to me


while trying to find her,


looked at me


as though my eyes would


reveal the reason


for her departure.


Kissed me like my lips


were burning with her name;


my moans gathering,


he tried to find her tune.


I stayed, didn’t I?


Tried to show him


what lies within me


is better than what she offered.


I held his head


looked into his eyes,


screaming in anger


“I am here! I am here! Look at me!”


Oh my love,


I soon learnt


she branded her being


through his blood


to the beginning of his soul.


I foolishly


offered flowers


to a man


seeking water.
