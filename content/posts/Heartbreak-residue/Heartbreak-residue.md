I've been thinking a lot about how poets say grief is a beast,


or a looming shadow,


or some cold bottomless lake,


but for some reason


It's different with you.


It's more common than that.


There was no darkness when you left


the sun kept it's pulse,


yesterday came and went


the only difference is the way we carried ourselves 


after losing the weight of one another.


What im trying to say is that our disaster was natural.


I'm not running from monsters or reaching for the surface,


rather i'm living with a new noticeable layer of deprivation 


that i think somehow is residue 


Losing you was destructive, sure 


but it was also organic 


like the way landslides carve wounds into the faces of mountains,


how wind uproots evergreens,


and even how dust settles after a desert storm.


In the day dream I keep returning to 


we are living on different sides of the country 


I am in a studio surrounded by my stories 


and you are filling in your own blanks 


Life has grown over our changed terrain


We've recovered.
