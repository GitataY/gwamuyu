I cook pilau for my husband

Just the way he loves it 

With enough ground pepper chili. 

I hand wash his underwear 

And press the wrinkles on his clothes

With the overpriced steamer 

I got from kamukunji as a dutiful wife 



I am a somebody's wife 



I learnt how to make his body shake inside me 

I've waxed underneath as they suggested

I cooked his food with a little less spice 

When my husband's preference changed 


I check the blogs 

Then learnt to go down 

rising his manhood

Just like the pastor's wife had said in whispers one Sunday afternoon after the sermon. 


The other day, 

He moaned the housemaid's name 

The next morning, 

I gathered her clothes quietly 

And bought a bus ticket for her 

Everyone knows the concubine 

Cannot compete with the wife 

Under the same roof. 


Today, 

My husband returned reeking of his lover's cheap perfume 

That devil! 

I prepared his favourite meal 

I oiled his skin

I lowered the light from the oil lamp,

I let him enter me 

As I watch his shadow shake. 

I remember not to scream his brother's name.
